Trying out unit testing.

I used one of the Redux examples as a starting point to try out unit testing and see how it works with React and Redux. I also made my own test in the file `Link.spec.js` that checks if the component gets rendered correctly.

Some results:

The tests that are running live while coding.

The coverage report.

In this example there is need for many more tests to get the coverage up to the 100%.
